### ðŸ“Œ **Microservices Architecture for Order & Product Services**  

This system is built using **Spring Boot & Spring Cloud**, designed for scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. It follows a **distributed microservices** approach where each service is independent but communicates via well-defined APIs.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Key Microservices:**
1. **Product Service** â€“ Manages products, inventory, and details.  
2. **Order Service** â€“ Handles order creation, tracking, and management.  

#### **ðŸ”¹ Supporting Components:**
- **Spring Cloud Config Server** â€“ Centralized configuration management using Git.  
- **Eureka Discovery Server** â€“ Service registry for dynamic service discovery.  
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** â€“ API Gateway for routing and security.  
- **Spring Boot Actuator** â€“ Monitoring and health checks.  
- **Database** â€“ Each microservice has its own **dedicated database** to ensure loose coupling.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Flow of Requests:**
1. **User Request â†’ API Gateway** (Routes requests to the appropriate microservice).  
2. **Microservice fetches configs** from Config Server.  
3. **Microservice discovers peers** via Eureka.  
4. **Database operations** for persistence.  

This architecture ensures **scalability, resilience, and fault tolerance** while enabling services to evolve independently.
