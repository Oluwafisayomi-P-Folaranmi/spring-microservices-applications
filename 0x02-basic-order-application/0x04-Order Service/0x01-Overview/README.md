# Overview

Let's discuss how another service, an Order Service, say `OrderService` can communicate with a Product Service, the `ProductService` in our microservices architecture.

- **Product Service**: Manages product details such as product ID, name, description, price, and inventory.
- **Order Service**: Handles customer orders, which includes creating orders, checking product availability, and reducing product inventory.

By using **RESTful APIs** or **Feign clients**, the `OrderService` can efficiently communicate with the `ProductService` to check product availability and update inventory when creating orders. This setup helps maintain a loosely coupled and scalable microservices architecture.
